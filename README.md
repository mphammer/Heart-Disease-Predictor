# Probability of Heart Failure - Website

This is a Web Application where users can enter their own information and it outputs their likelihood of having some form of heart disease. Keep in mind that heart disease is a broad term that covers incidents like strokes, heart attacks, and heart failure. 

## About the Dataset

This Data was downloaded from Kaggle: 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction/data

Ideally we would have a lot more data than this in order to confidently draw conclusions. However, for this project we will pretend that there is enough.
